## [Read the op-ed in The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/587590-democrats-should-be-courting-romney-not-manchin)

In a [new op-ed](https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/587590-democrats-should-be-courting-romney-not-manchin), I argue that Democrats are more likely to pass cash assistance in reconciliation with Senator Mitt Romney as the 50th vote than with Senator Joe Manchin.
Unlike Manchin, Romney supports a fully refundable Child Tax Credit, and has proposed a plan to achieve it called the Family Security Act.
[My UBI Center analysis](family-security-act) of the Family Security Act shows that it would be progressive and effective, largely by virtue of its near-universality among children.
And while Manchin has opposed multiple carbon pricing proposals, Romney supports a carbon dividend, a small UBI funded by fees on polluting corporations.
In a [separate UBI Center analysis](us-carbon-dividend), I showed that a carbon dividend would reduce poverty as well as emissions.
