On Friday, the UK Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng [announced a series of tax cuts](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1105989/CCS207_CCS0822746402-001_SECURE_HMT_Autumn_Statement_2022_BOOK_Web_Accessible.pdf) to National Insurance, Income Tax, and stamp duty, reaffirming key campaign pledges by UK Prime Minister Liz Truss. The most prominent of these cuts is the reversal of an [earlier tax rise](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-and-social-care-levy/health-and-social-care-levy) by the previous Chancellor, Rishi Sunak: cutting all National Insurance rates by 1.25 percentage points.

[As described on the PolicyEngine blog, this is a regressive tax cut](https://blog.policyengine.org/tax-cuts-in-prime-minister-trusss-growth-plan-2022-a4a862892dc1): households in higher income deciles see higher increases to their net income, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of their income. As a combined set of policies, they will reduce tax revenues by £16.2bn per year ([see the full PolicyEngine results here](https://policyengine.org/uk/population-impact?dividend_basic_rate=7_5&dividend_higher_rate=32_5&NI_add_rate=2&NI_class_4_add_rate=2&NI_main_rate=12&NI_class_4_main_rate=9&dividend_additional_rate=38_1&basic_rate=19&sdlt_on_non_first_home_2_rate=0&sdlt_first_time_buyer_value_limit=625000&sdlt_on_first_time_buyer_homes_2_threshold=425000&add_rate=40)).

There is an alternative. Distributing that same £16.2bn among the UK population as a universal payment would amount to around £250 per person. It would be progressive: the bottom decile would see its income increase by 5.0%, compared to the 0.4% increase it will see under the NI rate cut. All deciles below the eighth come out ahead on average.

Under Truss’ tax cut, the poverty rate falls slightly (around 1.4%). This is expected: the tax cut is of little financial value to those at or near the poverty line, let alone those far below it. For the same net cost, a universal transfer would have a poverty reduction over 7 times greater - causing a fall of 10.0%. Senior poverty falls the most: by over 12%.

    $(document).ready(function(){

    });

In addition to greater poverty impacts, trading the tax cuts for universal payments would reduce inequality (for example, cutting the Gini index by 2%) and benefit 65% of the population, as [the full PolicyEngine model](https://policyengine.org/uk/population-impact?basic_rate=20&dividend_basic_rate=8_75&dividend_higher_rate=33_75&NI_add_rate=3_25&NI_class_4_add_rate=3_5&NI_main_rate=13_25&NI_class_4_main_rate=10_25&sdlt_on_non_first_home_2_rate=2&sdlt_first_time_buyer_value_limit=500000&sdlt_on_first_time_buyer_homes_2_threshold=300000&child_bi=4_3&adult_bi=4_3&senior_bi=4_3&dividend_additional_rate=39_35&baseline_basic_rate=19&baseline_dividend_basic_rate=7_5&baseline_dividend_higher_rate=32_5&baseline_NI_add_rate=2&baseline_NI_class_4_add_rate=2&baseline_NI_main_rate=12&baseline_NI_class_4_main_rate=9&baseline_sdlt_on_non_first_home_2_rate=0&baseline_sdlt_first_time_buyer_value_limit=625000&baseline_sdlt_on_first_time_buyer_homes_2_threshold=425000&baseline_dividend_additional_rate=38_1) shows.

The tax cut benefits lower-income households than cash for a  simple reason: the tax base (earned income) is a smaller part of their gross income. At the lowest end, households source the majority of their income from benefits or pensions.

For a married couple with two children, the UBI policy outperforms the tax cuts until employment income reaches £62,000. The tax cuts are designed to phase in with income, but the gains increase at haphazard intervals: starting slowly with the rate cuts to National Insurance and Income Tax, through a sudden jump as claimants move off Universal Credit earlier, and with a substantial increase in work incentives after £150,000. The UBI policy is far simpler by comparison.

You can see how the payment affects your household vis-a-vis the tax cuts [in PolicyEngine here](https://policyengine.org/uk/household?basic_rate=20&dividend_basic_rate=8_75&dividend_higher_rate=33_75&NI_add_rate=3_25&NI_class_4_add_rate=3_5&NI_main_rate=13_25&NI_class_4_main_rate=10_25&sdlt_on_non_first_home_2_rate=2&sdlt_first_time_buyer_value_limit=500000&sdlt_on_first_time_buyer_homes_2_threshold=300000&child_bi=4_3&adult_bi=4_3&senior_bi=4_3&dividend_additional_rate=39_35&baseline_basic_rate=19&baseline_dividend_basic_rate=7_5&baseline_dividend_higher_rate=32_5&baseline_NI_add_rate=2&baseline_NI_class_4_add_rate=2&baseline_NI_main_rate=12&baseline_NI_class_4_main_rate=9&baseline_sdlt_on_non_first_home_2_rate=0&baseline_sdlt_first_time_buyer_value_limit=625000&baseline_sdlt_on_first_time_buyer_homes_2_threshold=425000&baseline_dividend_additional_rate=38_1).

CPI inflation, by which absolute poverty thresholds are uprated, is [projected to remain above 10% for the rest of the year](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/knowledgebank/will-inflation-in-the-uk-keep-rising). As the widest-reaching tax-benefit policy, universal cash payments are the most effective way to prevent further rises in absolute poverty. The previous Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s support measures [leaned on flat cash transfers](https://blog.policyengine.org/impact-of-the-chancellors-cost-of-living-support-package-5c4557b84696) for wide sectors of the population, enabling gains to reach families often left out: those not on benefits or tax databases. Many of the tax reforms announced today mark a complete reversal of policy only introduced this year. Whether or not this is repeated, future policymakers have a much more effective tool for reducing poverty at their disposal in the universal dividend.
