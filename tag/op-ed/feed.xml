&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/587590-democrats-should-be-courting-romney-not-manchin&quot;&gt;new op-ed&lt;/a&gt;, I argue that Democrats are more likely to pass cash assistance in reconciliation with Senator Mitt Romney as the 50th vote than with Senator Joe Manchin.
Unlike Manchin, Romney supports a fully refundable Child Tax Credit, and has proposed a plan to achieve it called the Family Security Act.
&lt;a href=&quot;family-security-act&quot;&gt;My UBI Center analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the Family Security Act shows that it would be progressive and effective, largely by virtue of its near-universality among children.
And while Manchin has opposed multiple carbon pricing proposals, Romney supports a carbon dividend, a small UBI funded by fees on polluting corporations.
In a &lt;a href=&quot;us-carbon-dividend&quot;&gt;separate UBI Center analysis&lt;/a&gt;, I showed that a carbon dividend would reduce poverty as well as emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my latest op-ed, I argue that cash assistance policies (the expanded Child Tax Credit and $1,400 checks) were some of the most popular and effective parts of the American Rescue Plan; that they would have been even better if closer to universal basic income; and that we should double down on those cash successes with a permanent child allowance and carbon dividend.
